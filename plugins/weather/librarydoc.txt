DESCRIPTION
    Pymetar is a python module and command line tool designed to fetch Metar
    reports from the NOAA (http://www.noaa.gov) and allow access to the
    included weather information.

CLASSES
    MetarReport
    
    class MetarReport
     |  This class provides a means to download and parse
     |  the decoded METAR reports from http://weather.noaa.gov
     |  
     |  In order to find the report relevant for you, find
     |  the closest station at
     |  http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/siteloc.shtml and feed
     |  its 4-letter station code to fetchMetarReport(), 
     |  case does not matter.
     |  
     |  All methods return metric values, no matter what the
     |  station provides. The conversion factors were taken
     |  from the excellent "units" program.
     |  
     |  If None is returned that means the information wasn't
     |  available or could not be parsed. If you have the suspicion
     |  that failure to parse an information was this libs fault,
     |  please save the report generating the error send it to
     |  me with a few lines detailing the problem. Thanks!
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  _ClearAllFields(self)
     |      Clears all fields values.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, MetarStationCode=None)
     |      Get initial report if a station code is passed as a parameter,
     |      otherwise initialize fields.
     |  
     |  extractCloudInformation(self)
     |      Extracts cloud information.  returns None or a tuple 
     |      (sky type as a string of text and suggested pixmap name)
     |  
     |  extractSkyConditions(self)
     |      Extracts sky condition information from the encoded report.
     |      Returns a tuple containing the description of the sky conditions as
     |      a string and a suggested pixmap name for an icon representing said
     |      sky condition.
     |  
     |  fetchMetarReport(self, station, baseurl='http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/decoded/')
     |      Retrieve the decoded METAR report from the given base URL and parse
     |      it.
     |      Fill the data properties in the class instance with the values
     |      found in the report, converting them to metric values where
     |      necessary.
     |  
     |  getCycle(self)
     |      Return cycle value.
     |      The cycle value is not the frequency or delay between observations
     |      but the "time slot" in which the observation was made. There are 24
     |      cycle slots every day which usually last from N:45 to N+1:45. The
     |      cycle from 23:45 to 0:45 is cycle 0.

     |  
     |  getStationLatitude(self)
     |      Return the station's latitude in dd-mm[-ss]D format :
     |             dd : degrees
     |             mm : minutes
     |             ss : seconds
     |             D : direction (N, S, E, W)
     |  
     |  getStationLatitudeFloat(self)
     |      Return latitude as a float
     |  
     |  getStationLongitude(self)
     |      Return the station's longitude in dd-mm[-ss]D format :
     |             dd : degrees
     |             mm : minutes
     |             ss : seconds
     |             D : direction (N, S, E, W)

     |  
     |  getStationPosition(self)
     |      Return latitude, longitude and height above sea level of station as
     |      a tuple. Some stations don't deliver height, for those, None is
     |      returned as height.  The lat/longs are expressed as follows:
     |      xx-yyd
     |      where xx is degrees, yy minutes and d the direction.
     |      Thus 51-14N means 51 degrees, 14 minutes north.  d may take the
     |      values N, S for latitues and W, E for longitudes. Latitude and
     |      Longitude may include seconds.  Height is always given as meters
     |      above sea level, including a trailing M.
     |      Schipohl Int. Airport Amsterdam has, for example:
     |      ('52-18N', '004-46E', '-2M')
     |      Moenchengladbach (where I live):
     |      ('51-14N', '063-03E', None)
     |      If you need lat and long as float values, look at 
     |      getStationPositionFloat() instead
     |  
     |  getStationPositionFloat(self)
     |      Return latitude and longitude as float values in a tuple (lat,long)

     |      Note that this is *not* the time when the report
     |      was fetched by us
     |      Format:         YYYY.MM.DD HHMM UTC
     |      Example: 2002.04.01 1020 UTC

     |      Return wind direction in degrees.
     |  
     |  getWindSpeed(self)

     |      WARNING : Some Metar reports may contain several matching

     |  
     |  metar_to_iso8601(self, metardate)
