MeBox Canvas System
===================

NOTE: some of the stuff in this README is obsolete.


About
-----

This code was written as part of a larger project of mine called MeBox.  You
can read about it, and also more about the canvas system, at:

	http://sault.org/mebox/

The canvas essentially provides a simple way to manipulate images.  The main
feature of this canvas system is its ability to render on top of MPlayer's
video buffer with full alpha compositing using bmovl2.

bmovl2 is an MPlayer video filter which accepts commands via a FIFO from a
separate process.  It borrows the basic approach from the original bmovl
filter, but it has been rewritten to allow for the features provided by this
canvas.

An overview of the canvas architecture can be found in README.canvas.  The
file src/canvas.py also has some amount of documentation as part of the
comments.  You can find a few examples in the examples/ directory; they
should be fairly self explanatory, although unless the MPlayer binary you've
compiled with the patches is in /usr/local/bin/mplayer, you'll have to edit
the example scripts and update MPLAYER_CMD to point to the correct binary.

bmovl2 is reasonably efficient but it still requires a fairly fast machine,
especially given that the video is scaled/expanded to the canvas size.
Performance is pretty good on my Athlon 1400, and you have some control
with CPU usage based on the number of images on the canvas and their sizes,
but nevertheless you'll probably want at least a 1GHz CPU to do anything
useful.


Requirements
------------

To run the examples, you will need to patch MPlayer.  The patch can be
found in the patches/ directory; it is diffed against CVS from the date
indicated in its filename.

The canvas and image modules expect pyimlib2.  Pyimlib2 can be downloaded
at:
	http://sault.org/mebox/downloads.php

Pyimlib2 is also, as you may have guessed, very alpha software.

One gotcha about the examples: keyboard input must be done at the console
window where you run the examples, NOT the MPlayer window.  So if, for
example, in the osddemo you hit 'o' and think, "Hrmm, this just looks like
MPlayer's regular OSD" it's because you're pressing the key with the video
window focused, not the console window. :)
