pyimlib2 - python module for Imlib2
=========================================

   NOTE: This isn't meant to be a formal release but rather just a demo
   of some of the stuff I'm working on.  As a result, it may suck
   unbelievably or be outright broken.


About
-----

Pyimlib2 is a python module for Imlib2.  It is terribly incomplete.  Its 
main raison d'être is to provide image manipulation routines for MeBox.

PyImlib2 requires Imlib2 1.1.1 or later, which can be gotten here:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2&package_id=11130

I've packaged RPMs for both Imlib2 and pyimlib2 for convenience.  You can 
download them, as well as the most recent version of pyimlib2 at:

   http://sault.org/mebox/downloads.php

Only a small part of the Imlib2 API has been wrapped.  If you want to help by
adding more methods, patches will be happily accepted.


Installation
------------

Assuming you already have Imlib2 installed, you can install pyimlib2 with:

	make && make install
